# <span style="color:#8B322C">You made it! Hi!</span> 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Let me tell you a little bit about what I do:

## <span style="color:#4793AF">Research Methods + Data Analysis</span> 📚📊

I am passionate about conducting high-quality research and translating data-driven insights into pragmatic and actionable results. I have expertise in various research methodologies, including experimental design, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, concept mapping, social network, and qualitative analysis. I am well-versed in using statistical tools and techniques, such as hypothesis testing, ANOVA, regression analysis, and data visualization.

## <span style="color:#FFC470">Data Strategy</span> 📈🔍

One thing that I think sets me apart is my eye for <span style="color:#FFC470">data design</span> AND <span style="color:#FFC470">strategy</span>.

I spend a LOT of time thinking about data. This leads to thoughtful and intentional data structures that ensure data is organized, standardized, and stored in a manner that enables easy access, retrieval, and maintenance (Shout out to Open Science Framework!). A well-designed data structure ensures data integrity, minimizes redundancies, and facilitates efficient data manipulation and analysis.

## <span style="color:#DD5746">Coding in R</span> 💻👓

I'm an R enthusiast. That mean's I might be annoying to people who use other languages for academic research. I love using it for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling. From data wrangling with tidyverse packages to creating interactive visualizations with ggplot2, I enjoy leveraging the full potential of R's ecosystem in my projects.

## <span style="color:#8B322C">Let's Connect!</span> ✉️🤝

I am always eager to collaborate, learn from others, and contribute to exciting projects. If you'd like to discuss research opportunities, data analysis projects, or simply connect with me, feel free to reach out!
